              <p>
                This is a visual inspection only. The scope of this inspection
                is to verify the proper performance of the home's major systems.
                We do not verify proper design.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following items reflect the condition of the home and its
                systems at the time and date the inspection was performed .
                Conditions of an occupied home can change after the inspection
                (e.g., leaks may occur beneath sinks, water may run at toilets,
                walls or flooring may be damaged during moving, appliances may
                fail, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Furnishings, personal items, and/or systems of the home are not
                dismantled or moved. A 3–4 hour inspection is not equal to
                "live-in exposure" and will not discover all concerns. Unless
                otherwise stated, we will only inspect/comment on the following
                systems:
                <em
                  >Electrical, Heating/Cooling, Appliances, Plumbing, Roof and
                  Attic, Exterior, Grounds, and the Foundation</em
                >.
              </p>
              <p class="callout-info">
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> This inspection is not a warranty or
                insurance policy. The limit of liability of
                <strong>AGI Property Inspections</strong> and its employees does
                not extend beyond the day the inspection was performed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cosmetic items (e.g., peeling wallpaper, wall scuffs, nail
                holes, normal wear and tear, etc.) are not part of this
                inspection. We also do not inspect for fungi, rodents, or
                insects. If such issues are noted, it is only to bring them to
                your attention so you can have the proper contractor evaluate
                further.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although every effort is made to inspect all systems, not every
                defect can be identified. Some areas may be inaccessible or
                hazardous. The home should be carefully reviewed during your
                final walk-through to ensure no new concerns have occurred and
                that requested repairs have been completed.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Major Defects:</strong> These are issues that affect the
                home's structural integrity, or might lead to significant
                expense if not addressed. These items are color-coded
                <span class="text-danger">red</span> in the report and need
                immediate attention.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Safety Hazards:</strong> Anything that poses an
                immediate risk to occupants if not addressed. These items are
                also color-coded <span class="text-danger">red</span> in the
                report and need Immediate Attention.
              </p>
              <h4 class="text-warning"><strong>Items for Repair:</strong></h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Defects:</strong> Items that ultimately need repair,
                like plumbing and electrical issues, damaged, inoperable, or
                improperly installed items. These items are color-coded
                <span class="text-warning">orange</span> in the report.

              <h4 class="text-info"><strong>Maintenance Items:</strong></h4>
              <p>
                The report will also list maintenance items that are not
                included in the Summary. Maintenance suggestions and
                recommendations are for your long-term care of the home. They
                are important for upkeep and knowledge but do not typically need
                immediate repair.

              <h4>Important Information & Limitations</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>AGI Property Inspections</strong> performs all
                inspections in compliance with the Louisiana Standards of
                Practice. We inspect readily accessible, visually observable,
                permanently installed systems and components of the home. This
                inspection is not technically exhaustive or quantitative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some comments may go beyond the minimum Standards as a courtesy
                to provide additional detail. Any item noted for repair,
                replacement, maintenance, or further evaluation should be
                reviewed by qualified, licensed tradespeople.
              </p>
              <p>
                This inspection cannot predict future conditions or reveal
                hidden or latent defects. The report reflects the home’s
                condition only at the time of inspection. Weather, occupancy, or
                use may reveal issues not present at the time.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report should be considered alongside the seller’s
                disclosure, pest inspection report, and contractor evaluations
                for a complete picture of the home’s condition.

              <p>
                If the home was occupied at the time of inspection, some areas
                may not have been accessible (furniture, personal belongings,
                etc.). Every effort was made to inspect all accessible areas;
                however, some issues may not have been visible.

                issues were missed and that the property remains in the same
                condition as at the time of inspection.
