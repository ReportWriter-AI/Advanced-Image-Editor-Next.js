Knowing the panel's location and that main breaker may benefit all family members. This is where you would reset a tripped breaker or cut off the power in the event of an emergency.Knowing where the main water shut-off is can help minimize water damage and avoid costly repairs if there's a plumbing emergency. There should be a main shutoff located on the property that is accessible at all times, and if I was able to find it, its location will be provided in this section. Sometimes it's buried or under brush and is hard to see. Like with other shutoffs, it's essential to know where the main gas shutoff is. It's typically located at the gas meter or at the propane tank if propane is the gas supply. Some homeowners like to set their main water and gas shutoffs to the off position. So if you are turning it off at the main as a proactive solution to a leak or issue that comes up while you are away from home for an extended period, that's ok. However, if you are home and ever feel like you have a gas leak, don't go to the shutoff and try to turn the gas off. Leave the property and call the local utility company, and they will send someone right out.I have done my best to find the locations of all of these shutoffs for you and listed them in this section, with a picture and a location tag.",

          "comment": "FINAL WALK-THROUGHThe walk-through prior to closing is the time for you to go back to the property to ensure there aren’t any major changes. Conditions can change between the time of a home inspection and the time of closing. Restrictions that existed during the inspection may have been removed for the walk-through, which could expose issues that weren’t visible the day of the inspection.The following are recommendations of things you can check during your final walkthrough.1. Check the heating and cooling system. Turn the thermostat to heat mode and turn the temperature setting up. Confirm that the heating system is running and making heat. Turn the thermostat to cool mode and turn the temperature setting down. Confirm the condenser fan (outside equipment) is spinning and the system is making cool air. 2. Operate all appliances; oven/stove, dishwasher, microwave, etc.3. Run the water at all plumbing fixtures, both inside and outside, and flush toilets.4. Operate all exterior doors, windows and locks. Sudden change of functionality with any of these, could indicate serious issues, like foundation movement. 5. Test smoke/carbon monoxide detectors, following the manufacturers instructions. Only their presence or absence is reported on.6. Ask for all remote controls to any garage door openers, fans, gas fireplaces, etc so that you can ensure that the sellers have them and that they work. If not, this could be your last opportunity to have them correct that.7. Inspect areas that may have been restricted or covered, at the time of the inspection. There are videos in your report of any such restrictions present at the time of the inspection. 8. Ask seller questions about anything that was excluded from the home inspection; irrigation systems, security codes, smart equipment, etc.9. Ask seller about any warranties that may be transferable or subscriptions like, pool, pest control, security.10. Read sellers disclosure.The links below connect you to a series of documents that will help you understand your home and how it works.ROOFING, FLASHINGS AND CHIMNEYS-http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_1_Roofing_2011.pdfEXTERIOR -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_2_Exterior_2011.pdfSTRUCTURE -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_3_Structure_2011.pdfELECTRICAL -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_4_Electrical_2011.pdfHEATING -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_5_Heating_2011.pdfCOOLING/HEAT PUMPS -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_6_Cooling_2011.pdfINSULATION -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_7_Insulation_2011.pdfPLUMBING -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_8_Plumbing_2011.pdfINTERIOR -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_9_Interior_2011.pdfAPPLIANCES -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_10_Appliances_2011.pdfLIFE CYCLES and COSTS -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_11_Life_Cycles_2011.pdfENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_12_Supplementary_2011.pdfHOME SET-UP AND MAINTENANCE -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_13_Maintenance_2011.pdfMORE ABOUT HOME INSPECTIONS -http://www.discoverhorizon.com/hrb/PDFS_2011/HRB_14_Appendix_A_2011.pdfENERGY SAVING WEBSITES/TIPS:Perhaps you never thought of your home as a likely place to save you a lot of money, but it can be. Most homes are far from being energy-efficient. That means if you are using more energy than you have to, you are also paying higher monthly bills than necessary. We can to an energy evaluation with thermal imaging and make recommendations where improvements can be made. By checking out the following energy saving web-sites, you will be able to gain some energy saving ideas that you will most likely be able to put to use right away. You can do many of them yourself, others may require the services of a more qualified contractor:http://www.energystar.gov/http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/building_americahttp://www.aceee.org/consumerguidehttp://www.efficientwindows.org",

          "comment": "Purpose: The home inspection report (Report) was prepared by AGI: Property Inspections (AGI) for the specific purposes of assessing the general condition of the building and identifying defects that are readily apparent at the time of inspection based on the limited visual, non-invasive inspection as further described below in the Scope and Limitations & Exclusions sections.No responsibility is accepted if the Report is used for any other purpose.Scope: The Report is based on a limited visual, above-ground, non-invasive inspection of the standard systems and components of the building. AGI does not open up, uncover or dismantle any part of the building as part of the inspection or undertake any internal assessment of the building, aside from the electrical panel deadfront.Report Limitations & Exclusions: The Report is an evaluation only and not a guarantee or warranty as to the state of the building or any product, system, or feature in the building.AGI accepts no responsibility or liability for any omission in its inspection or the Report related to defects or irregularities which are not reasonably visible at the time of the inspection or which relate to components of the building:1. which are below ground or which are concealed or closed in behind finished surfaces (such as plumbing, drainage, heating, framing, ventilation, insulation, or wiring);2. which required the moving of anything that impeded access or limited visibility (such as floor coverings, furniture, appliances, personal property, vehicles, vegetation, debris, or soil). AGI does not move owner/occupier items for the inspection, to which access is not readily accessible. This may also include roofs, subfloors, ceiling cavities, and high, constricted, or dangerous areas, for which dangerous, hazardous, or adverse situations are possible.In addition, the customer understands and accepts that it's possible that AGI will not find some defects because the defect may only occur intermittently or the defect has been deliberately concealed. If you believe that any of these circumstances apply, you should immediately contact AGI to try and resolve them.Any area, system, item, or component of the building not explicitly identified in the Report as having been inspected was not included in the scope of the inspection. This consists of the condition and location of any special features or services, underground services drainage, or any systems including electrical, plumbing, gas, or heating except as otherwise may be described in the Report.Descriptions in the Report of systems or appliances relate to the existence of such systems or appliances only and not the adequacy, efficiency, or life expectancy of such systems or appliances.The Report: is not a structural survey, engineer's report, or weather tightness inspection; does not assess compliance with the requirements of any legislation (including any act, regulation, code, or by-law) unless otherwise stated; is not a geotechnical, site or environmental report. AGI makes no representation as to the existence or absence of any hazard (as defined in the Health and Safety in Employment Act) or any hazardous substance, natural hazard, or contaminant (as those terms are defined in the Resource Management Act) in the building or property.AGI has not undertaken any title search and assumes all improvements are within the legal boundaries of the property.No property survey or any search of the information held by the territorial authority or any other relevant authority has been undertaken. It is recommended that the customer conducts its own Land Information Memorandum or Council property file search.Unit Title Properties: If the property is a Unit Title property, the inspection and Report are limited to the actual unit and any accessory unit(s) and do not extend to the remainder of the building or the common areas.AGI recommends the customer obtain a copy of the financial statements and minutes from meetings of the Body Corporate to establish the history of the inspected property under such Body Corporate.Responsibility to Third Parties: Our responsibility in connection with this Report is limited to the client to whom the Report is addressed and to that client only. We disclaim all responsibility and will accept no liability to any other party without first obtaining the written consent of AGI and the author of the Report.AGI reserves the right to alter, amend, explain, or limit any information given to any other party.Publication: Neither the whole nor any part of the Report (or any other report provided by AGI, whether written or verbal) may be published or included in any published document, circular, or statement whether in hard copy or electronic form or otherwise disseminated or sold without the prior written approval of AGI and the inspector.Claims & Disputes: Should any dispute arise as a result of the inspection or the Report, it must be submitted to AGI in writing as soon as practically possible but in any case, within ten working days of discovery. The customer agrees that in the event of a dispute, the Report's contents may not be used to satisfy any terms of a sale and purchase agreement until the disagreement/dispute has been resolved. In the event the customer nevertheless enters into an unconditional agreement for the purchase of the subject property or makes an existing agreement unconditional before the resolution of the dispute, the customer shall be deemed to have waived the customer's rights to continue with and/or make any future claim against AGI in relation to that matter.Any claim relating to the accuracy of the Report, in the form of errors or omissions, is limited to the failure on the part of AGI to follow the Standards of Practice promulgated by the Louisiana State Board of Home Inspectors (a copy is made available for viewing along with the Pre-Inspection Agreement).Except in the case of an emergency, the customer further agrees not to disturb, repair, replace, or alter anything that may constitute evidence relating to the dispute or claimed discrepancy before AGI has had an opportunity to re-inspect and investigate the claim. The Client understands and agrees that any failure to notify AGI or permit AGI to re-inspect as stated above shall be deemed a waiver of the customer's rights to continue with and/or make any future claim against AGI about that matter.Limitation of Liability: The customer acknowledges and agrees that the director(s) and employee(s) of AGI shall not be held liable to the client.AGI shall have no liability to the client for any indirect or consequential loss suffered by the client or any other person. The client indemnifies AGI concerning any claims concerning any such loss.Subject to any statutory provisions, if AGI becomes liable to the customer for any reason, for any loss, damage, harm, or injury in any way connected to the inspection and/or the Report, AGI’s total liability shall be limited to a sum not exceeding the original fee of the home inspection.Consumer Guarantees Act: Nothing contained in these terms and conditions shall be deemed to exclude or restrict any rights or remedies that the client may have under the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 or otherwise at law.Partial Invalidity: If any provision in these terms and conditions is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed to be excluded or read down to the extent necessary to make the provision legal, valid, or enforceable, and the remaining provisions of these terms and conditions shall not be affected.",
